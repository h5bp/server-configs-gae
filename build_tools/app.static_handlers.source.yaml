# This is a source of data for a script that assembles the actual
# app_static_handlers.yaml file that is imported in app.yaml

# The static hander file works as a sifter - only allows
# specific, explicitly listed extensions to be treated as static files.

# Only the files with extensions mentioned below will be exposed
# as static content. If a file's extension is not here, it will not
# be uploaded or served as static content.

# The schema is "inspired" by one defined in `handlers` section of
# https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig
# with the following additional notes:

# - Here we only concentrate on `extensions` and, hence,
#    `extensions` here replaces `url`, 'upload' and 'static_files' key-value pairs
#    that you would normally see in 'handlers" section in regular app.yaml file.
#    The value of the `extensions` key is one that would work if it were inserted
#    into the following regular expression:
#       '(?:^/(.+\.(' + value of extension key + ')))'
#    and can be a single extension or a "|"-separated list of them.
# - If you need advanced routing regex magic, alter the .mustache templates directly.
