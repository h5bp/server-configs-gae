# This is a source of data for a script that assembles the actual
# app_dynamic_handlers.yaml file that is imported in app.yaml

# Here we list the dynamic edges we are exposing as wsgi applications

# We need to know the dynamic edges in order to prefix all static handlers
# with exclusionary prefix for the dynamic edges.

# The schema is "inspired" by one defined in `handlers` section of
# https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig
# with the following additional notes:

# Instead of `url` node `path_prefix` is used and is considered to be the
# "folder" name/path that is the URI prefix for the dynamic app.
# The `url` entry is formed automatically by using this rule:
# '/' + path_prefix.strip('/') + '/.*'

handlers:

- path_prefix: /api/
  script: api.main.application

- path_prefix: /_ah/warmup
  script: api.main.application
