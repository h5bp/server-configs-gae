#!!!! AUTO-GENERATED FILE !!!!

# All folders everywhere are considered static unless defined as dynamic
# Thus, files from everywhere could can be "static", but they must be explicitly
# listed file extensions. Files for extensions not listed here, will not be served.

# Thus you are free to put "static" content anywhere you want, including the root
# folder, but don't forget to add extensions to the static handlers source file
# and regenerate the yaml file that is actually included into app.yaml

# The extensions are inserted into a url regex pattern that will look like this:
# (?:^/   insures that nothing is captured if some part fails and consumes leading slash
#   (?!api/)   insures that path does not start with one of dynamic folders
#   (?!admin/)   --- || --- (we allow multiple top-level dynamic folder to be excluded
#   (.+\.(html|htm))   the extension(s)
# )

# FYI: default static content expiration is set in app.yaml and is usually days long
